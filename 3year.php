              <h5 style="text-align: center; font-family: Century Gothic;">This lesson is all about the prison in RRCY Enrile, Cagayan that touches my life for a second </h5> <p></p>
              <h6 style="text-align: center; font-family: Century Gothic;">
                Trip to a joyful pain is an experience where you can share yourselves, where you can meet strange people, know more about your friends and personalities. The one thing that is important in this world is LISTENING every person in this world has its own sorrow, problems and a fresh wounds that change their lives because of their imperfections. Every human being has its responsibility to listen to their neighbors to know what happened to them and how did they solve their problems because that is the greatest lesson and achievement you’ve ever receive and a true paulinian should be.

                December 3, 2016 this day challenge me as an IT paulinian student to come and join my classmates to go to a trip not just to bond, not just to laugh together but we came as a son of God and have a good will to spread his good news to our brothers in Regional Rehabilitation Center for Youth (RRCY) Roma, Enrile. As we group our self together I suddenly observe to their faces the sorrow, regret and loneliness and the best and simplest thing I can only do for them is just to tap their shoulders to comfort them. The most painful thing that happened in this outreach is the sharing I was shocked to what they have done, they’ve cross their boundaries and extended their limitations that’s the reason why they are in rehabilitation. I suddenly realize I am very much lucky to have a parent like mine because they guided me to the right path of life even thou they shouted at me everyday because of laziness, have a curfew, punishments and misunderstanding sometimes this is just OK for me I still love them. One of the RRCY member shared to me how he wish to go back again in school to learn how to read and write because honestly he can not read fluently but how this wish make’s a reality if his life in the outside world is at risk because of his situation, not all of us have the opportunity to go to school so i will strive and do all my best to review my lessons, submit my requirements on time, lessen the time in playing computer games and be responsible all the time to finish my study and hopefully graduated in the year 2018. The best lesson that this outreach realize to me is the “secret of success is ambition” and this ambition serve as my compass to guide me in this very strange of life I have, I should take risk anything for my ambition because that what I called DEDICATION.

                In conclusion, this outreach program has a lot of realization, one of that is I should strive more for my study, I should always listen to the people who has a problem because that’s the only thing I can comfort them, I should know my limitations, I should not give up and I should not allow my problems to defeat me because problems is a chance for me to do my best. Truly being a paulinian make’s a difference globally and I’m proud of it.</h6>
